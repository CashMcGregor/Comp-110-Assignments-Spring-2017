The territory of Alaska was recognized as a state of the United States of America on March 30, 1867.

* Known as Seward's folly by opponents of the purchase in reference to Secretary of State William H Seward.
* It added more than 580,000 square miles of land to the USA.
* Alaska Day is celebrated on October 18th because the Gregorian calendar had to be changed over from the Russian-used Julian calendar.
